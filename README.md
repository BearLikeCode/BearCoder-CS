# The Open Source Computer Science Degree

At this moment I have three different programs for CS:
1. [Forest Knight](https://github.com/ForrestKnight/open-source-cs)
2. [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science)
3. [MIT](http://catalog.mit.edu/degree-charts/computer-science-engineering-course-6-3/)

My plan compare everything, select between first language (Java or Python) and build a plan.
